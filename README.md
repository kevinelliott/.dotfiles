# .dotfiles

Dotfiles for your unix-like system. I've created this little repository to setup my OSX development machine. You're free to clone this
for your own use, or pull out items. Definitely fork this and make your own repository, and submit pull requests if you've made
something cleaner or more useful. I love seeing what other people do to optimize their shells, and I'm constantly looking for
general productivity improvements.

# Install

To install, you will be cloning this repository into ~/.dotfiles.

	cd ~
	git clone git@github.com:kevinelliott/.dotfiles.git

Then you will activate the .dotfiles by including the following line to ~/.bash_profile

	source ~/.dotfiles/base.sh

# Credits

Thanks to @drnic for his own .dotfiles repository for inspiration and the idea for how to set this up. Look at his repositories if
you'd like to see some other examples for how to do this.
